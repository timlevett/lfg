# lfg

WoW-inspired raid frames on a 64x64 LED panel for monitoring your coding agents.

## What is this?

lfg turns a [$25 iDotMatrix LED panel](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-idotmatrix-64x64.html) into a real-time raid frame display for your AI coding agents. Each agent gets a sprite, a player ID, and a status icon — just like watching your party in a 10-man raid.

**States:**
- **Working** — agent is actively using tools (sword/potion/compass icon)
- **Idle** — agent has stopped (zzz with marching border)
- **Requesting** — agent needs approval, i.e. *standing in fire* (fire icon with marching border)

The most important thing lfg does is make idle and approval states impossible to miss. When an agent needs you, you see the fire icon in your peripheral vision without switching windows.

## How it works

```

   lfg (Rust server)

   BLE → iDotMatrix 64x64 LED
```

lfg receives webhook events (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, `Stop`, etc.) and manages an agent state machine. The render pipeline:

1. Every 250ms, the display state is hashed and compared to the last sent frame
2. On change, a 2-second debounce timer starts — rapid tool calls don't spam the display
3. After 2s of stability, lfg renders a 6-frame animated GIF from the current state
4. The GIF is split into 4KB packets and sent over BLE to the iDotMatrix panel
5. If any agent is in the Requesting state, the animation runs faster (0.5s/frame vs 1.25s/frame) so the fire icon pulses urgently

In `--no-ble` mode, lfg runs as an HTTP-only server — useful for testing the webhook pipeline and state machine without hardware. Use `POST /debug/gif` to export the current display as a GIF file.

## Features

- **10 agent slots** across 5 columns, 2 rows — grouped by host (IDE/terminal)
- **11 sprite themes** — Slimes, Ghosts, Space Invaders, Pac-Men, Mushrooms, Jumpman, Creepers, Frogger, Q*bert, Kirby, Zelda Hearts
- **5 ability icons** — Star (subagent), Sword (write/edit/bash), Potion (think), Chest (read), Compass (search/web)
- **BLE auto-discovery** and reconnection with heartbeat keepalive
- **SQLite persistence** for cumulative stats across restarts
- **Stats bar** — agent-minutes, tool calls, unique agents
- **Multi-IDE support** — Claude Code, Cursor, and OpenAI Codex CLI via [boopifier](https://github.com/terraboops/boopifier)
- **HTTP API** for status, reset, theme switching, and debug GIF export

## Quick start

### Hardware

You need an iDotMatrix 64x64 LED panel (~$25 on AliExpress). Any `IDM-*` BLE device should work.

### Install

```bash
# Homebrew (macOS)
brew tap terraboops/tap
brew install lfg
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/terraboops/lfg.git
cd lfg
cargo build --release
```

### Run

```bash
# Auto-discovers IDM-* BLE device
lfg

# Without BLE (HTTP-only, for testing)
lfg --no-ble
```

### Secure setup (optional)

By default lfg binds to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only), so it is not reachable from other machines. If you want an extra layer of protection — for example, if you share a machine or run lfg on a server — you can require an auth token on every request:

```bash
lfg --token mysecrettoken
```

All HTTP requests (webhooks and API calls) must then include the token as a Bearer header:

```
Authorization: Bearer mysecrettoken
```

Requests without a valid token receive a `401 Unauthorized` response.

To wire this up with the hook script, set the `LFG_TOKEN` environment variable before your IDE starts:

```bash
export LFG_TOKEN=mysecrettoken
```

The hook script reads `LFG_TOKEN` and forwards it automatically. A safe place to set this is your shell's login profile (`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.config/fish/config.fish`) so it is always present when the IDE launches.

> **Note:** The token is passed on the command line, so it will appear in `ps` output. For stronger isolation, localhost-only binding (the default) is usually sufficient for a personal machine.

### Configure hooks

lfg receives events via HTTP webhooks. There are two ways to connect your IDE:

#### Option A: Standalone (no dependencies beyond curl + jq)

Copy the hook script and make it executable:

```bash
cp examples/hooks/lfg-hook.sh ~/.local/bin/lfg-hook.sh
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/lfg-hook.sh
```

**Claude Code** — add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      { "matcher": "", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "lfg-hook.sh" }] }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      { "matcher": "", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "lfg-hook.sh" }] }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      { "matcher": "", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "lfg-hook.sh" }] }
    ],
    "SubagentStop": [
      { "matcher": "", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "lfg-hook.sh" }] }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Cursor** — add to `~/.cursor/hooks.json`:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "preToolUse": [{ "command": "lfg-hook.sh" }],
    "postToolUse": [{ "command": "lfg-hook.sh" }],
    "beforeShellExecution": [{ "command": "lfg-hook.sh" }],
    "afterShellExecution": [{ "command": "lfg-hook.sh" }],
    "afterFileEdit": [{ "command": "lfg-hook.sh" }],
    "stop": [{ "command": "lfg-hook.sh" }],
    "sessionStart": [{ "command": "lfg-hook.sh" }],
    "sessionEnd": [{ "command": "lfg-hook.sh" }]
  }
}
```

**Codex CLI** — Codex uses two files: a feature flag in `~/.codex/config.toml` and hook definitions in `~/.codex/hooks.json`.

`~/.codex/config.toml`:
```toml
[features]
codex_hooks = true
```

`~/.codex/hooks.json`:
```json
{
  "PreToolUse": [{ "command": "LFG_HOST=codex ~/.local/bin/lfg-hook.sh" }],
  "PostToolUse": [{ "command": "LFG_HOST=codex ~/.local/bin/lfg-hook.sh" }],
  "SessionStart": [{ "command": "LFG_HOST=codex ~/.local/bin/lfg-hook.sh" }],
  "Stop": [{ "command": "LFG_HOST=codex ~/.local/bin/lfg-hook.sh" }]
}
```

> **Note:** The older `[[hooks.pre_tool_use]]` TOML entries in `config.toml` are not fired by current Codex versions. Use `hooks.json` with PascalCase event names instead.

Environment variables: `LFG_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:5555/webhook`), `LFG_HOST` (default `claude`), `LFG_TOKEN` (unset by default — set to match `--token` if auth is enabled). Set `LFG_HOST=cursor` for Cursor hooks, `LFG_HOST=codex` for Codex CLI.

**OpenCode** — OpenCode uses a native plugin system. Copy the plugin and add to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:

```bash
cp examples/opencode/lfg-bridge.js ~/.config/opencode/plugins/
```

`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:
```json
{
  "plugin": ["./plugins/lfg-bridge.js"]
}
```

See [examples/opencode/README.md](examples/opencode/README.md) for details on global vs project-specific installation, environment variables (`LFG_WEBHOOK_URL`), and troubleshooting.

#### Option B: With boopifier (adds sound alerts, multi-handler routing)

Install [boopifier](https://github.com/terraboops/boopifier), then copy the example configs:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/lfg
cp examples/hooks/boopifier-claude.json ~/.config/lfg/
cp examples/hooks/boopifier-cursor.json ~/.config/lfg/
cp examples/hooks/boopifier-codex.json ~/.config/lfg/
```

Then point your IDE hooks at boopifier — see `examples/hooks/claude-code-boopifier.json`, `examples/hooks/cursor-boopifier.json`, and `examples/hooks/codex-boopifier.json` (plus `codex-boopifier.toml` for the feature flag) for the hook configs.

Boopifier adds features like sound alerts on Stop events, per-host sprite themes, and multi-destination routing.

#### Manual / testing

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5555/webhook \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text": "PreToolUse|session-id-here|Bash"}' \
  -G -d 'host=claude'
```

See `examples/hooks/` for all example configs.

### API

```bash
curl localhost:5555/status          # Current state
curl localhost:5555/hosts           # Host/agent mapping
curl -X POST localhost:5555/reset   # Clear everything
curl localhost:5555/theme           # List themes
curl -X POST localhost:5555/theme/2 # Set theme (Space Invaders)
```

## The state machine

Getting agent state right is the hard part. Hooks fire out of order and overlap — `PermissionRequest` and `PreToolUse` arrive ~100μs apart for the same tool, and `PostToolUse` fires after every tool call, not just approvals.

The key design decisions:

- **Requesting is sticky** — only cleared by `PostToolUse` (approval granted + tool ran) or `Stop`/`SessionEnd`
- **PreToolUse won't override Requesting** — prevents the fire icon from flickering away while blocked on approval
- **PostToolUse doesn't transition to Idle** — tools fire rapidly in sequence; only `Stop` means truly idle
- **Idle and Requesting always win** from `Stop`/`SessionEnd` and `PermissionRequest` respectively
